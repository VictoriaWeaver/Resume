        Currently aiding in the development of the Android Application for a bacteria scanning device. 
        Android Studio is used to develop the application for Android 4.2.  Components of the application 
        contributed to include analysis of the test results of scanning the bacteria through the use 
        of plots as well as the grouping of locations to be tested in order to improve organization 
        and increase efficiency of testing.
