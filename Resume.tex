    \begin{asparadesc}
        \employer{Xelic, Inc.}{Pittsford, NY}{Summer 2017}{Product Development Engineering Intern}
        {http://xelic.com/}
        \small Worked on the verification for multiple functions of an existing networking IP core, written in VHDL.  Collaborated on the design of blocks for a networking IP core in Verilog HDL, relating to Optical Transport Network (OTN)/packet processing.
        \\
        \employer{Critical Link LLC}{Syracuse, NY}{Summer-Fall 2016}{Engineering Intern}
        {http://criticallink.com/}
        \small
        Aided in the research for application of Hall Effect sensors for proximity sensing.  
        Research includes possible concerns and risks of the application, and design, implementation, and analysis of 
        test circuits.  Strict deadlines were assigned for different stages of the project.\smallskip\\
        Aided in the development of the Android application for a bacteria-scanning device.  Mainly focused on the development of the user 
        interface and analysis of data readings.  Specific customer specifications were given for the project. 
        \\
        \employer{Parsons Government Services}{Centreville, VA}{Summer 2015}{Personal Computer Support Tech Intern}
        {http://parsons.com/}
        \small
        Worked on Java back end development in an Eclipse environment with a focus on fixing existing 
        issues in a networking security application. Collaborated on the documentation of the installation 
        of a service for the project on a clean virtual machine running Ubuntu. Tested and verified 
        different components of the application and submitted defect tickets through JIRA.  Collaborated 
        in code reviews using Review Board.
