\section{\mysidestyle Professional Summary}
    Computer Engineer seeking a full time position in a fast-paced environment in which skills in digital logic design and verification can be applied.  Qualified by logic design and development experience in previous work positions as well as a strong academic background.


\section{\mysidestyle Work Experience}
    \begin{asparadesc}
        \employer{Northrop Grumman Corporation}{Baltimore, MD}{March 2018 - Present}{Electronics Engineer I}
        {http://northropgrumman.com/}
        \small Implemented the whirligig function in VHDL for an Electronically Steering Antenna.  Used HDL Designer to aid in the implementation of state machines and used ModelSim to simulate and debug the behavior.  Documentation was also written to describe the functionality of the whirligig component.\medskip\\
        Debugged a SPI bus implemented in VHDL through simulations in ModelSim and in hardware with the use of an oscilloscope.  Required closely following documentation of certain components and protocols in order to find any timing violations or larger issues in functionality of the design.\medskip\\
        Ran fit tests for a board migration from UltraScale to UltraScale+.  Required resource analysis after many place and routes in Xilinx Vivado.
        \\
        \employer{Xelic, Inc.}{Pittsford, NY}{Summer 2017}{Product Development Engineering Intern}
        {http://xelic.com/}
        \small Worked on the verification for multiple functions of an existing networking IP core, written in VHDL.  Collaborated on the design of blocks for a networking IP core in Verilog HDL, relating to Optical Transport Network (OTN)/packet processing.
        \\
        \employer{Critical Link LLC}{Syracuse, NY}{Summer-Fall 2016}{Engineering Intern}
        {http://criticallink.com/}
        \small
        Aided in the research for application of Hall Effect sensors for proximity sensing.  
        Research includes possible concerns and risks of the application, and design, implementation, and analysis of 
        test circuits.  Strict deadlines were assigned for different stages of the project.\medskip\\
        Aided in the development of the Android application for a bacteria-scanning device.  Mainly focused on the development of the user 
        interface and analysis of data readings.  Specific customer specifications were given for the project. 
        \\
        \employer{Parsons Government Services}{Centreville, VA}{Summer 2015}{Personal Computer Support Tech Intern}
        {http://parsons.com/}
        \small
        Worked on Java back end development in an Eclipse environment with a focus on fixing existing 
        issues in a networking security application. Collaborated on the documentation of the installation 
        of a service for the project on a clean virtual machine running Ubuntu. Tested and verified 
        different components of the application and submitted defect tickets through JIRA.  Collaborated 
        in code reviews using Review Board.
