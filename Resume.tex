        \small
        Aided in the research for application of Hall Effect sensors for proximity sensing.  
        Research includes possible concerns and risks of the application, and design, implementation, and analysis of 
        test circuits.  Strict deadlines were assigned for different stages of the project.\smallskip\\
        Aided in the development of the Android application for a bacteria-scanning device.  Mainly focused on the development of the user 
        interface and analysis of data readings.  Specific customer specifications were given for the project.
