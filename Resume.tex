	Infrared Proximity Sensor- IR LEDs are used for proximity sensing.  The proximity of an object is displayed on a scrolling 7-segment display and indicated with auditory feedback. \\

	\noindent LED Table- LEDs are connected in a grid with cover of diffused Plexiglass, which is connected to Arduino Uno board and programmed to make various patterns and animations.\\

	\noindent Encryption Algorithm Speeds- RSA and a symmetric key algorithm are implemented in Java and the runtime speeds are used to compare the algorithms.
